Fillups is an application that allows users to record their vehicle fillups at the gas station and view various reports about their consumption. 

The UI is primarily jQuery and the service is built with Sinatra and MongoDB using Mongoid as the mapping layer and rspec and jasmine as the testing frameworks. Other tools I intend to use are rcov, shoulda, factory_girl and autotest.

Eventually (or maybe sooner than I expect) I'll use devise's OAuth facilities.


Fillup document is made up of:
 - vehicle name
 - location
 - odometer
 - gallons
 - date
 - rate
