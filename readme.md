# Fillups

Fillups is a sample application that allows users to record their vehicle fillups at the gas station and view various reports about their consumption. It's a sample because it represents an excuse to learn some things I'm interested in.

The UI will primarily be jQuery/jQTouch with PhoneGap and the service will be built with Sinatra and MongoDB using Mongoid as the mapping layer and RSpec and Jasmine as the testing frameworks. Other tools I intend to use are rcov, autotest and maybe shoulda and factory_girl.

I'm also very interested in using Devise's OAuth facilities.

_Please stay tuned ..._
